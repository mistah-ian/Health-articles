        <h1>The Origin of HIV: A Historical Overview</h1>

        <section>
          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>
            The Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), the virus responsible for AIDS (Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome),
            has had a profound impact on global health since its discovery in the early 1980s. But its origins trace back
            much furtherâ€”deep into the forests of Central and West Africa, where it crossed into humans from non-human primates.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Zoonotic Origins: From Primates to People</h2>
          <p>
            HIV is a zoonotic virus, meaning it originated in animals before infecting humans. There are two main types of HIV:
            <strong>HIV-1</strong> and <strong>HIV-2</strong>.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>HIV-1</strong>: Originated from chimpanzees in Central Africa (SIVcpz).</li>
            <li><strong>HIV-2</strong>: Originated from sooty mangabey monkeys in West Africa (SIVsmm).</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            These cross-species transmissions likely occurred through hunting and consumption of bushmeat, where humans came into contact with infected blood.
          </p>

        <section>
          <h2>How and When Did HIV Spread Among Humans?</h2>
          <p>
            Genetic studies suggest HIV-1 crossed into humans several times, but only one strain (group M) caused the global pandemic.
            The earliest known case in humans was found in a blood sample from 1959 in Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of Congo.
          </p>
          <p>
            Contributing factors to the spread included:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Urbanization and growing populations</li>
            <li>Increased travel and trade</li>
            <li>Unsafe medical practices</li>
            <li>Social changes including increased sex work</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>The Discovery of HIV</h2>
          <p>
            In 1981, unusual illnesses appeared in the U.S., marking the beginning of AIDS awareness. By 1983, scientists had identified the virus.
            It was initially named LAV in France and HTLV-III in the U.S., later unified under the name HIV.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Conclusion</h2>
          <p>
            HIV's origin shows how viruses can cross from animals to humans and spread under the right conditions.
            Understanding its history helps us prevent future pandemics and improve public health responses.
